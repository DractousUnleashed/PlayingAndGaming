# SuperJumpy Man

## Purpose

A simple game that has the user collect stars to add to their overall score in an attempt to get the highest score that they can while avoiding bouncing bombs that are flying around the screen. The user is to use the arrow commands to move the character to achieve the action of getting the stars and to also avoid the bombs.

## API Usage

This game uses two server-side API's which are spotify and a weather API that gives the user access to songs on the left side of the screen by clicking the button and weather information down at the bottom to remind the user that going outside is a bad idea and to just stay inside to enjoy the game.
