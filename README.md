# SuperJumpy Man

## Purpose

A simple game that has the user collect stars to add to their overall score in an attempt to get the highest score that they can while avoiding bouncing bombs that are flying around the screen. The user is to use the arrow commands to move the character to achieve the action of getting the stars and to also avoid the bombs.

## API Usage

This game uses two server-side API's which are spotify and Phaser that gives the user access to songs on the left side of the screen by clicking. Then Phaser makes the entire game run as it is constantly sending information to our server in how the game should respond to certain situation. It is what adds the gravity to the game and how the characters can move.

## Framework

Using conventional coding methods alongside Phaser, Spotify, and Bulma (our CSS framework), we were able to structure a game that sports a fun, simple, easy to play adventure while also being able to listen to certain soundtracks that are given.

## Controls

By using the arrow keys on the keyboard, you are free to move right, left, and up. Below is an image of the project and how it looks.
